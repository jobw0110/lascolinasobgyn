	<p>At Las Colinas OB/GYN, we offer comprehensive obstetric and gynecological services. We also offer an expanded line of services and procedures to better meet the demands of our patients. These include:</p>
	<p><ul>
		<li>offering alternatives to hysterectomies,</li>
		<li>providing a cutting edge non-surgical solution to permanent birth control,</li>
		<li>recommending proper nutrition to aid with weight management,</li>
		<li>sleep disorders and libido issues</li>
	</ul></p>
	<p>At Las Colinas OB/GYN we offer patients a holistic approach to maintaining optimum health.</p>
	<p>For example, a decrease in women’s sexuality or any negative change since delivery of her baby can now be addressed and easily improved.</p>
	<p>The minor surgery to restore normal anatomy is done frequently and with great success. This is a benefit covered by all insurance companies. The recovery is usually a few days but can take up to two weeks, depending on the woman’s needs.</p>
	<p>Painless procedures done in our offices are more economical, typically only requiring your office copay. Below is a representative list of services we offer, click on any one to read more details. If you have a medical need that does not seem to be addressed in this list, please contact us for a consultation.</p>
		<h2>Obstetrics</h2>
		<div>
			<p>We work with women in all stages of their pregnancy. From initial pregnancy testing through childbirth and the recuperative period following delivery.</p>
		</div>
		<h2 id="General">General Gynecology</h2>
		<div>
			<p>At Las Colinas ObGyn, we offer complete health care for women. Our gynecology services include a full range of routine care, as well as procedural and technological interventions.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Office Hysteroscopy</h2>
		<div>
			<img src="images/image_02.jpg">
			<p>Las Colinas ObGyn performs both diagnostic and therapeutic office hysteroscopy.</p>
			<p>Office hysteroscopy is used to evaluate patients with abnormal uterine bleeding resistant to medical management or to perform a panoramic visualization of the uterine cavity. </p>
			<p>With the patient in dorsal lithotomy position, the cervix is visualized with the help of a speculum and washed with a prep solution. The hysteroscope, usually held in place by a tenaculum, is introduced under direct vision into the cervix, and a paracervical and intracervical block administered if necessary. Occasionally a small dilator may be used to probe the canal. The hysteroscope is used to identify polyps and fibroids and to biopsy specific areas of abnormality.</p>
			<p>The entire procedure takes less than 15 minutes. Generally, the most uncomfortable part of the process for the patient is the biopsy rather than the hysteroscopy itself.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Hysteroscopic Sterilization</h2>
		<div>
			<img src="images/image_02.jpg">
			<p>Are you looking for a new approach to permanent birth control? Las Colinas OB/GYN offers a procedure (performed in our office, typically covered by your office copay) called <a href="http://www.essure.com/" target="_blank">Essure</a>.</p>
			<p>The Essure procedure is a nonincisional surgical procedure that involved placing a small, flexible device called a micro-insert into each of your fallopian tubes (the tubes your eggs travel through from your ovaries to your uterus). The micro-inserts are made from polyester fibers and metals (nickel-titanium and stainless steel). These materials have been studied and used in the heart and other parts of the human body for many years. Once the micro-inserts are in place, over a three-month period your body tissue grows into the micro-inserts, blocking the fallopian tubes. Blocking the tubes is intended to prevent sperm from reaching and fertilizing the egg, thereby preventing pregnancy.</p>
			<p>The following observations were made based on two separate studies of the safety and effectiveness of the Essure Permanent Birth Control System:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>No incisions are required</li>
				<li>Can be performed without general anesthesia </li>
				<li>Essure does not contain hormones</li>
				<li>Effective</li>
				<li>Rapid recovery</li>
				<li>High patient satisfaction</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you would like to find out if Essure is right for you, please <a href="http://www.lascolinasobgyn.com/contact.php">contact us</a> for a consultation.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Endometrial Ablation</h2>
		<div>
			<img src="images/image_02.jpg">
			<p>If heavy periods interfere with your life, you are not alone.</p>
			<p>Did you know that one in five women suffer from heavy periods? This bleeding can be emotionally and physically devastating, causing many women to limit their activities and lifestyles.</p>
			<p>Many options are available, including drug therapy, minimally invasive treatments, or a hysterectomy. <!--<a href="http://www.heroption.com/" target="_blank">Her Option® </a>, The <a href="http://www.novasure.com/" target="_blank">Novasure® System</a>&nbsp; and-->The <a href="http://www.bostonscientific.com/en-US/health-conditions/heavy-menstrual-bleeding/genesys-hta-system-procedure.html" target="_blank">Genesys HTA™ System</a>&nbsp; is an option for women with heavy periods that are looking for an alternative to a hysterectomy.</p>
			<p>This option can be performed in our office. Most patients find the procedure to be relatively pain free. If you would like to find out more, please <a href="http://www.lascolinasobgyn.com/contact.php">contact us</a> for a consultation.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Urinary Incontinence</h2>
		<div>
			<img src="images/image_02.jpg">
			<p>Las Colinas ObGyn offers complete female evaluation of urinary incontinence, including cystoscopy multichannel cystometrics.</p>
			<p>Many women leak small amounts of urine at times. These leaks can occur with certain physical activities or with other stress, such as coughing. Women may lose urine when they hear the sound of running water or when their hands are in water. Some women feel the urge to urinate and cannot control it. Others leak urine only while they are pregnant. When leaks become frequent or severe enough to be a problem, it is called urinary incontinence, or loss of bladder control.</p>
			<p>There are many options for treatment. Often treatments are more effective when used in combination.</p>
			<p><h5>Behavioral Treatments</h5> The goal of behavioral treatment is to help a woman know why leaks occur and how to avoid them.</p>
			<p><h5>Physical Therapy</h5> There are many types of physical therapy that can be done to treat urinary incontinence. One type, Kegel exercises, can help strengthen the pelvic. </p>
			<p><h5>Devices</h5> Sometimes devices can be used to make the pelvic muscles stronger or to block urine.</p>
			<p><h5>Medications</h5> Drugs that help control muscle spasms can help prevent leaks. Others can strengthen the muscle of the urethra. Some help relax a bladder that is too active. </p>
		</div>
		<h2>Anal Incontinence</h2>
		<div>
			<img src="images/image_02.jpg">
			<p>Las Colinas ObGyn can perform a complete female evaluation of anal incontinence including anal manometry and pudendal nerve latency testing.</p>
			<p>Anal incontinence, the loss of anal sphincter control, leads to the unwanted release of solid or liquid stool or gas. Even when it occurs only occasionally, anal incontinence can have catastrophic consequences on self-confidence, personal image, and the ability to integrate socially and in employment.</p>
			<p>There are many causes of anal incontinence, including congenital disorders of the spinal cord or anus; subsequent injuries to the rectum and anus; obstetric injuries during delivery; injury of the spinal cord; diabetic neuropathy (nerve damage); advanced Alzheimer disease or other forms of dementia; fecal impaction; and tumors.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Anal Sonography</h2>
		<div>
			<img src="images/image_02.jpg">
			<p>Las Colinas ObGyn has the expertise and equipment necessary to perform anal sonography for evaluation of the anal spincter.</p>
			<p>Anal sonography can be used to identify sphincter defects in approximately two thirds of incontinent patients. Prevalence is greater in patients with a history of proctologic surgery.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Anal Manometry</h2>
		<div>
			<img src="images/image_02.jpg">
			<p>Las Colinas ObGyn has the expertise and equipment necessary to  perform Anal Manometry to determine if bowel sensations are within normal range. Anal Manometry can be used to identify anal incontinence. </p>
		</div>
		<h2>Pelvic & Abdominal Ultrasonography</h2>
		<div>
			<img src="images/image_02.jpg">
			<p>Ultrasonography is an ideal clinical tool for determining the source of abdominal pain. It can simplify the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain, especially when pain and tenderness are present over the site of disease. Even if ultrasonography reveals no obvious etiology, it can facilitate diagnosis by excluding potentially life-threatening conditions. Emergency abdominal ultrasonography is indicated for the evaluation of aortic aneurysm, appendicitis, and biliary and renal colic, as well as blunt or penetrating abdominal trauma.</p>			
		</div>
		<h2>Laser for Cervix & Venereal Warts</h2>
		<div>
			<img src="images/image_02.jpg">
			<p>The human papilloma virus (HPV) is responsible for causing genital warts in the anus and genital area. More than 80 different specific types of HPV DNA have been identified. 45 of these can affect genital skin. The treatment for HPV can be difficult. In areas that are extremely resistant to treatment, you may sometimes ablate the warts with a carbon dioxide laser. If one has both a non healing lesion on the genitals and a personal history of venereal warts, then it is important that this non healing lesion be biopsied to rule out malignancy.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Loop Electrosurgery</h2>
		<div>
			<img src="images/image_02.jpg">
			<p>Las Colinas ObGyn can perform loop electrosurgery for diseases of the cervix.</p>
			<p>Cells on the cervix grow and shed all the time. Sometimes these cells change and become abnormal. This may be an early warning that cancer may occur. When tests show that you have abnormal cells on your cervix, we may suggest loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). LEEP is useful to remove the abnormal cells from your cervix. </p>
			<p>LEEP uses a thin wire loop that acts like a scalpel (surgical knife). An electric current is passed through the loop, which cuts away a thin layer of the surface cells. In most cases, LEEP is done in a doctor's office or in a clinic on an outpatient basis. It should take only a few minutes.</p>
			<p>The loop is inserted through the vagina to the cervix. There are different sizes and shapes of loops that can be used. After the procedure, a special paste may be applied to your cervix to stop any bleeding. The tissue that is removed will be studied in a lab to confirm the diagnosis. </p>
		</div>
		<h2>Pelvic Organ Prolapse Repair</h2>
		<div>
			<img src="images/image_02.jpg">
			<p>Pelvic organ prolapse occurs when pelvic structures (like the bladder or rectum) bulge or protrude into the vaginal wall. It can also be described as a hernia into the vaginal wall.</p>
			<p>Many different structures can prolapse. The bladder, the uterus, the vagina, the small bowel, or the rectum are common structures that can be herniated and cause prolapse.</p>
			<p>Pelvic Organ Prolapse Repair Systems may be the right option for you. We offer two systems developed by AMS (American Medical Systems) that take graft augmented vaginal surgery to a new level by standardizing minimally invasive approaches to restore function. Click to learn more about this procedure. </p>
		</div>
		<h2>Vaginal Reconstruction</h2>
		<div>
			<img src="images/image_02.jpg">
			<p>Does it feel like you have a mass bulging out of your vagina? Is walking or standing difficult? Is sexual intercourse painful? Do you have difficulty emptying your bladder or bowel?</p>
			<p>You may be experiencing pelvic organ prolapse. Prolapse occurs when pelvic structures, like the bladder or rectum, bulge or protrude into the vaginal wall. Bladder prolapse is sometimes referred to as cystocele. Rectal prolapse is referred to as rectocele. Sometimes, pelvic organ prolapse is described as a hernia into the vaginal wall or enterocele.</p>
			<p>Prolapse Repair Systems may be the right option for you. We offer two systems that take graft augmented vaginal surgery to a new level by standardizing minimally invasive approaches to restore function. We essentially restore to normal, the vaginal anatomy.</p>
		</div>
		<h2>Evaluation of Constipation, Lower Back Pain, & Sexual Dysfunction</h2>
		<div>
			<img src="images/image_02.jpg">
			<p>Patients with chronic constipation are on the average younger in age than their incontinent counterparts, but female predominance persists. A history of constipation may date back into childhood in some, or a few months only in other patients. The mechanism by which functional outlet obstruction occurs is still unknown, and it is questionable whether all patients represent one clinical entity only. At least one study claims to have identified different types of 'anismus', and another has suggested at least one cause of anismus to be sexual abuse in childhood or adulthood.</p>
			<p>In a more recently published study, a group which received verbal feedback by an instructor was compared with a group receiving feedback by visual display of pelvic floor EMG during straining. It was shown that the response rate was similar in both groups and resulted in symptom improvement of approximately 50%. The authors conclude that 'training in abdominal muscle contraction with pelvic floor relaxation is equally effective with or without a measuring device'; but admit that constant encouragement and praise by an instructor is necessary, as is a 'good rapport between patient and instructor'. </p>
		</div>
		<h2>Pelvic Muscle Rehab</h2>
		<div>
			<img src="images/image_02.jpg">
			<p>Las Colinas ObGyn offers biofeedback and physical therapy for rehabilitation of the pelvic muscle.</p> 
			<p>Biofeedback has helped many people combat the ill effects from involuntary muscle tension and related pain.</p>
			<p>The patient’s goal is to learn to control involuntary functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, skin temperature, and muscle tension. The therapist teaches the patient how to affect a particular function specific to a problem through mental or physical exercises (e.g. tense neck muscles).</p>
			<p>During the pelvic examination, we examine the strength and tone of the pelvic floor muscles. The pelvic floor muscles play an important role in continence and maintaining your pelvic organs in the normal position. During times of increased stress, like coughing or exercise, these muscles contract around the urethra and prevent urinary leakage. If these muscles, or the nerves supplying the muscles, are damaged or weakened, the mechanism maintaining continence fails.</p>
			<p>Many women can learn to strengthen their pelvic floor muscles. Just like lifting weights for upper and lower body muscles, repetitive exercise can increase the ability of pelvic floor muscle to function properly. For many women, properly performed kegel exercises can cure or improve urinary incontinence and mild symptoms of vaginal prolapse. This often decreases the need for surgery. Post surgical candidates also often decrease the chances of subsequent failure and repeat surgery.</p>
			<p>Pelvic muscle rehabilitation for patients with pelvic floor disorders combines the most effective non-surgical treatment modalities in an effort to restore normal tone and function to the muscles of the pelvic floor. Pelvic muscle rehabilitation may provide an additional element of reflex bladder inhibility. Pelvic muscle rehabilitation is based on all behaviors, including physiologic events that are a function of interacting sets of factors:</p>
			<p>Pelvic muscle rehabilitation treatment aims to improve continence by altering antecedent or consequent stimuli, or both. Pelvic muscle rehabilitation is a planned treatment program with these key components:</p>
			<ol style="padding-left:20px">
				<li>EMG muscle evaluation.</li>
				<li>Pelvic floor muscle exercise program.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>During pelvic floor rehabilitation, we work one-on-one with our therapist to help locate and isolate your pelvic floor muscles. Together we will use computer-assisted visual aids and a variety of exercise devices to normalize the function of pelvic floor muscles. The initial consultation is usually one hour. Based on this evaluation and the progress made, further rehabilitation sessions may be recommended. </p>
			<p>When we identify extremely weak muscles we may recommend pelvic floor rehabilitation.
			Continued pelvic floor exercises are extremely important after surgery for prolapse or incontinence, and should become a lifelong habit. Surgery may be only part of the solution as strong pelvic floor muscles can aid in preventing a recurrence of urinary leakage problems.</p>
			<p>The goal of pelvic muscle training is to isolate the pelvic floor muscle, specifically the levator ani. The pelvic floor muscles compromise a striated, skeletal muscle group that is under voluntary control and is important in maintaining urinary and fecal continence as well as in providing support to the pelvic organs.</p>
