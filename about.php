	<h3>Vaginal Restoration Clinic of North Texas</h3>
	<p>We restore vaginal anatomy which has been distorted as a result of pregnancy, (as well as other conditions), commonly known as Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP). The symptoms of POP include urinary incontinence (leaking urine accidentally), constipation, vaginal or pelvic pressure, low back pain, or feel a "bulge" in the vagina. Women often perceive this condition as "things have fallen," or complain that "my vagina just doesn’t feel the same." Woman often report "my intimate life has changed for the worse" or "it doesn’t feel the same anymore". Call us for a consultation to evaluate and help restore your pelvic anatomy like you were for your first pregnancy. With over 25 years of experience, we have the diagnostic tools to thoroughly evaluate the anatomy and function of your pelvic structures. These procedures often take less than an hour and can be done as an outpatient. You can often return to work in less than an week.</p>
